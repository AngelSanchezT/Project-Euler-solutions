# Project Euler solutions in Python

This directory contains solutions to Project Euler problems implemented in Python.

## Folder structure

- `Problem1`: Solution to Problem 1.
- `Problem2`: Solution to Problem 2.
- ...

## Instructions for use

- Each problem folder contains a `solution.py` file that contains the corresponding solution implementation.
- You can browse and run the solution files in a Python runtime environment, such as a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE).
- Remember that these files contain solutions to the problems, so we recommend that you try to solve them yourself before consulting these solutions.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute your own Python solutions! If you have a different or more efficient solution, you can add it in a new problem folder or improve an existing solution. We would love to see your contributions!
