## Structure of the repository

The directory and file structure in this repository is as follows:

```
project-euler/
├── problems/
│ ├── problem1.js
│ ├── problem2.js
│ ├── ...
│ └── problemX.js
└── tests/
├── problem1.test.js
├── problem2.test.js
├── ...
└── problemX.test.js
```

The `problems/` directory contains the files with the solutions to Project Euler problems. Each problem has its own file, for example: `problem001.js`, `problem002.js`, etc.

The `tests/` directory contains the unit test files for each problem. Each test file corresponds to the solution of a problem, for example: `problem001.test.js`, `problem002.test.js`, etc.
